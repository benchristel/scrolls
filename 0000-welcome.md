_Scrolls of the Apprentice_ aims to teach wizardly computer programming to complete beginners. You'll learn the basics of **JavaScript**, the language that underlies almost every website in the Universe, and before long, you'll be creating games like [this](demo) and writing scary stuff like this:

```javascript
$.forAll(enemies,  function (enemy) {
    smite(enemy)
    if (enemy.hp === 0) {
        console.log("Victory over " + enemy.name + "!")
    }
})
```

What you'll need
----------------

In order to follow along with the programming projects in this book, you'll need a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer with an up-to-date version of [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome/browser). Other web browsers (Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer) also have the code-editing and debugging tools you'll need to do the projects, but their interfaces are all different. For the sake of simplicity and cross-platform compatibility, the screenshots in this book will be taken from Chrome.

You'll also want a code editing program like [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads) (available for free for Mac, Windows, and Linux). Word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages aren't suitable for writing code&mdash;they have features like formatting and grammar-checking that are, at best, useless for coding, and at worst will cause your program not to work.

I'll assume you know how to download files from the Web, find them in your system, and open them in various applications. You should also be able to _right-click_ things. If you're on a Windows machine, you almost certainly have a two-button mouse or trackpad, so right-clicking just means clicking with the rightmost button on your mouse. If you have a Mac with a one-button mouse or trackpad, you can simulate a right-click by clicking while holding down the `control` key.

### Why "Scrolls"?

Anything with a _scrollbar_ can (should?) be called a _scroll_.
